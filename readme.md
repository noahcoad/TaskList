# Task List
A [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) Plugin

Toggles a Task List icon in front of the line.
Similar to "Toggle Comment", but cycles through emoji "icons"
Command is called "Toggle Task List" and is mapped to `command + option + t` on mac by default

Defaults:<br>
✡️ to do<br>
✅ done<br>

Edit `task_list.sublime-settings` to alter the emoji icons list to be used.

I also like to use:<br>
✴️ highlight<br>
🅿️ informational<br>
🆘 warning!<br>
