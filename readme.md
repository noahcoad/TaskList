# Task List
A Sublime 3 pluging

Toggles a Task List icon in front of the line.
Similar to "Toggle Comment", but cycles through emoji "icons"
Command is called "Toggle Task List" and is mapped to `command + option + t` on mac by default

Defaults:
✡️ to do
✅ done

Edit task_list.sublime-settings to alter the emoji icons list to be used.

I also like to use:
✴️ highlight
🅿️ informational
🆘 warning!
