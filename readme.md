# Task List
A [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) Plugin

Toggles a Task List icon in front of the line.
Similar to "Toggle Comment", but cycles through emoji "icons"
Command is called "Toggle Task List" and is mapped to `command + option + t` on mac by default

Defaults:<br>
✡️ to do<br>
✅ done<br>

Edit `task_list.sublime-settings` to alter the emoji icons list to be used.

I also like to use:<br>
✴️ highlight<br>
🅿️ informational<br>
🆘 warning!<br>

## For Example: `todo.txt`

:: today<br>
✅ order parts for automated sprayer<br>
✡️ update architecture diagram<br>
✡️ create POC proposal<br>
<br>
:: archive<br>
✅ change flight to Japan<br>
✡️ mail package to brother<br>
