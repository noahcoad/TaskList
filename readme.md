# Task List
A [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) Plugin

Toggles an Task List emoji in front of a line.
Similar to "Toggle Comment", but cycles through emoji "icons"
Command is called "Toggle Task List" and is mapped to <kbd>command+option+t</kbd> on mac by default

Defaults: \
‚ú°Ô∏è to do \
‚úÖ done \
‚ú¥Ô∏è highlight / warning \ 
üÖøÔ∏è informational / in progress \
üÜò not done / error \

Edit `task_list.sublime-settings` to alter the emoji icons list to be used.

## For Example: `todo.txt`

```
:: today
‚úÖ order parts for automated sprayer
‚ú°Ô∏è update architecture diagram
‚ú°Ô∏è create POC proposal 

:: archiv
‚úÖ change flight to Japan
